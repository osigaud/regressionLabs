# regressionLabs

This project provides the code of simple regression labs to approximate a one-dimensional function.

To test yourself on the corresponding labs, you need a Google account. Get [the regression lab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1plp6tnSkrrTVGz5n3yrRTMnNMy7rTX5g), copy-paste it and then answer the questions.
